my suggestions :
1 ) mountains ( jackson hole , aspen , banff ) are a nice respite from the houston summer . san diego ( or the baja peninsula ) are also nice - can combine golf , fishing and all kinds of outdoor activities . more exotic locales could include dominican republic , cabo san lucas ( 5 championship courses in vicinity ) , virgin islands , bermuda . i ' m not a big fan of las vegas ( although there is some good golf in the area ) .
2 ) focus should be on ( i ) improving communication across business units ( i ' m surprised by the number of people on this e - mail that i don ' t know ( well ) ) - perhaps presentations by each business unit reviewing 2000 and lh 2001 , ( ii ) identifying opportunities to profit from volatility in commodity and financial markets , ( iii ) create a "" road map "" strategic plan for the balance of 2001 and full year 2002 .
3 ) i love mountain climbing ( lived in switzerland for four years ) and am happy to organize beginner course and / or expedition with trained mountaineers . great team building therapy . otherwise , i ' m always up for golf , deep sea fishing , go kart racing , kayaking , skeet shooting , paint ball .
4 ) occasional off - sites are a great way to build / maintain morale and make sure everyone ' s on the same page regarding strategy / direction .
call if you want to discuss in more detail . i ' m serious about organizing mountain climbing .

hello everyone .
in december we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility . louise and i would like to get everyone together offsite , probably in late june ( once louise is back from holiday ( just kidding ) ) . i think it ' s time to go have a little fun with the group driving enron ' s success .
i would like suggestions as to :
1 ) where to go .
2 ) what should be the focus of the business meetings .
3 ) should we have business meetings or should we do something else ( ie . climb a mountain ) ? i ' m not a strong bid on climbing a mountain .
4 ) and any other ideas you have .
in addition i would like to start having staff meetings about once a month . the first one will be friday may 11 th at 2 : 30 p . m . please add this to your schedule . i have invited everyone who has p / l responsibility . portland , calgary and toronto will have to be on video or phone conference .

i wanted to give you a quick update on confirmlogic . . . .
testing was done last week on the confirmlogic module . on thursday , we
discussed with kathryn cordes and the confirmlogic it team the items that we
had found that were "" show stoppers "" as far as releasing the product for beta
testing . some of the major items found were the inability to properly handle
basis swaps for gas and inability to display meaningful index references for
power ( they were pulling in a code rather than a description of the index ) .
the team worked on the "" fixes "" and migrated the code last night . today
during testing , they found that the new code had actually caused problems
with the fixed price and volume information , which was working previously . i
talked to kathryn and she said that the were rebuilding the code . she said
that someone had tested the fix last night and everything worked fine . we
plan more testing in the morning .
they are doing a high - level demo this thursday for beta customers just to
introduce the module . they were planning on having more extensive beta demos
for each client starting next week but realize that those may have to
postponed further .
we have told them that we would not sign off for beta testing until we were
comfortable that the items that we identified were working . we need
consistent , stable days of testing before i will feel comfortable .
overall , we like the "" new "" streamlined version of the screens and feel that
it will be a good product if they can work out the data display issues .

kim , i know you have been interested in the development of a long term
natural gas model for use in the ets revenue management effort . i agree that
the ability to model various supply / demand scenarios for north america
should prove useful in ets business development efforts , and in particular ,
in predicting the impact of the new , large alaskan gas supplies on the n . a .
pipeline grid .
as you know , vince kaminski feels that a software product developed by dale
nesbitt ( marketpoint , inc . ) of los altos hills , ca . may be a good choice , and
one readily available in a relatively short time . marketpoint has proposed
that they work with us in our offices for a week of intensive training and
testing , so we can make a more informed decision before ordering the
software . they have proposed a charge of $ 12 , 000 , plus expenses , for the
one - week session , with that cost applied to the first year ' s subscription
price ( approx . $ 55 - 60 m / yr ) should we decide to go forward . the other
details ( timing , ene resources required , necessary it interface , etc ) still
need to be worked out , but i believe there is generally a consensus to
proceed with the test .
with my recent relocation to the clean fuels group , i will no longer be
responsible for the alaskan pipeline development . however , danny mccarty is
pulling together a team consisting of people from nng , nbp and elsewhere in
ets to push the project forward . i believe eric gadd will be playing a key
role as well . the decision on the long term gas model should appropriately
be made by the new project team .
i have attached a draft of the proposed marketpoint license agreement . it
has not yet been fully reviewed by legal ( or by shelley c . for the
"" affiliate "" issues ) .
let me know if i can provide any other background or assistance .

re : chapter 11 reorganization
financial reporting requirements
many people have questions regarding how enron will be operating under chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings . this memo addresses the financial reporting requirements enron will have to its various constituents .
during the reorganization , the company will continue its gaap reporting , with a breakout of pre and post petition liabilities , as well as historical management / operational reporting , consistent with past practices .
in addition , the company will have an added responsibility to report cash flows to the bankruptcy court and its various constituents . specifically , enron will be required to report projected cash receipts and cash disbursements by business unit on a weekly basis . the court and our new debtor - in - possession ( "" dip "" ) lenders require a rolling 13 week projection of cash flows plus monthly projections thereafter to obtain a full year of projected cash flows . the budgeted weekly projections will then be compared to actual results to determine how well each business unit is operating compared to the projections . the weekly and monthly forecasts will be adjusted each week pursuant to revised or improved information on forecasted cash flows . thus this process will be an ongoing one , with constant updating of information to ensure we generate the most accurate reports possible .
the initial weekly and monthly projections will be critical to the determination of the amount that the dip lenders will be willing to make available to the company . in addition , the cash flows for the entities that are included in the bankruptcy proceedings will be utilized by the bankruptcy court and dip lenders to constantly review and react to the cash flow situation at enron . however , all enron business units ( not just ones in bankruptcy ) will need to conform to these new requirements , because additional entities are likely to be included in the bankruptcy filing and because it is extremely important for enron management to be able to see the totality of cash flow requirements for the entire company .
the weekly cash flow projection project will be overseen by mike deville ( x 57852 ) and greg adams ( x 33887 ) . in addition , enron has retained batchelder & partners , inc . , a financial advisory firm , to assist us in this and other reorganization efforts .
we will be having a group meeting with the cao ' s and / or their designees from the various business units responsible for the cash projections on wednesday , december 5 at 2 : 00 pm in the boardroom on the 50 th floor to further explain this process and answer any questions you may have . we will then be meeting on an individual basis with the business units to discuss specific business unit requirements .
attached is a template of the financial statement projection format that will be required . please review this template in advance of the wednesday meeting to determine any questions you have on the reporting format . obviously the requirements may change , which will require us to reformat and / or obtain additional information on short notification .
thank you in advance for your cooperation . we look forward to your attendance on wednesday .",ENRON,0

joe ,
thanks for your note .
the purpose of the fmrc is to stimulate research on financial markets and to
provide a link between academic research , real world issues and regulation .
members of the center sit on the advisory board and help direct the research
of the center . they send an unlimited number of participants to center
conferences . our center is unique in its mix of academics , practitioners and
regulators . for members , such as enron , it provides a window on the academic
world , and would give enron an opportunity to stimulate research in the use
of markets in heretofore unusual commodities .
more information on the center can be found at
http : / / mba . vanderbilt . edu / fmrc /
center members include , nyse , nasdaq , cme , some high tech trading firms ,
merrill lynch . . . .
joining the center usually requires a top management decision , but i would
approach it through the research and the trading areas . one way to start is
to see if anyone in a position to recommend joining the center would like to
attend this year ' s conference on april 13 - 14 . the program is on the web
site . ( membership is $ 10 , 000 per year )
appreciate your interest and help .
let me know if we should provide more detail to someone .

subject : capital book
to further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing enron america ' s velocity of capital and associated return on invested capital , we have decided to create a capital book . the capital book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by joe deffner . the purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within enron americas , with any form of capital requirement , are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge .
the previous numbers used in the business plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets . therefore , on any assets currently held within each business area , the capital charge will remain at 15 % . internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating business unit subject to the internal ownership policy outlined below .
the cost of capital associated with all transactions in enron americas will be set by joe . this process is separate and apart from the current rac process for transactions which will continue unchanged .
capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15 % . transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15 % across the board charge . transactions which are structured off balance sheet , but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on enron america ' s overall credit capacity .
on transactions that deploy capital through the trading books , the capital book will take a finance reserve on each transaction , similar to the way the credit group takes a credit reserve . this finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction . as noted above , the capital book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost .
by sending market - based capital pricing signals internally , enron america ' s sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization .
questions regarding the capital book can be addressed to :

e hired tony to support global markets but jeff shankman decided that , given
highly specialized nature of his work it makes sense to put him in the
research group , with a dotted line to mike roberts who is running our weather
group .
given that his work will directly and exclusively benefit gm , it makes sense
for research to charge his expenses
to global markets . we can adjust allocations to reflect his contributions to

64,"Subject: cost sharing of subscription to poten ' s fuel oil report
all :
ideally we will split this cost evenly among as many p & l ' s as need the
report , minimizing everyone ' s cost by sharing a single subscription .
please tell me whether you can justify sharing the cost and if so , the rc
code & co # for me to allocate your cost share . please indicate your choice
of the three cost choices .
attached note below clarifies poten ' s proposal on the $ 10 , 000 / yr subscription .
essentially we have three choices :
1 . for $ 2700 / yr , the standard edition ( 11 issues , excluding the monthly
"" special feature "" article )
2 . for $ 3800 / yr the premium edition , ( standard edition plus the monthly
"" special feature "" article , as in three attached examples )
3 . for $ 10 , 000 / yr the premium edition plus quarterly forward price view for
36 months .
poten explains that 85 % of their subscribers take the premium service . no
one has ever asked for the $ 10 , 000 / yr long - term price forecast . i have an
interest in a longer term price forecast and hope that it may be useful to
others in the corporation .
the example copies attached include the following special feature articles :
99 feb - analysis of resid trades in the eastern mediterranean
99 sep - patterns of fuel oil trade in the western hemisphere
99 dec - analysis of the resid market in chile
one either takes all or none of them for the incremental $ 1100 / yr . some may
be useless , others perhaps quite valuable . your call .

i look forward to hearing from you .

subject : poten ' s fuel oil report
niamh & doug & margaret :
i want to chat about this and will call you , but the essence is :
can you justify sharing the cost of subscribing to poten ' s monthly fuel oil
report ?
attached below are 3 example copies that include their standard 12 month
price forecasts . the cost is $ 3800 / yr .
as an added service for a total of $ 10 , 000 / yr , poten will include a quarterly
update of their 36 month forward view on crude oil and fo prices with a brief
justification for their view . this would include the standard monthly price
forecast for the prompt 12 months and quarterly prices for the following 24
months for far east , med and nwe . ( i expect a more descriptive email from
poten , but i think this is the essence of their "" custom "" offer . )
the example copies attached include the following special features :
99 feb - analysis of resid trades in the eastern mediterranean
99 sep - patterns of fuel oil trade in the western hemisphere
99 dec - analysis of the resid market in chile
these type of features are produced monthly and run a spectrum of subjects
related to fuel oil .
i have a hard time justifying the cost of the newsletter and the price
forecast without the considered recommendation of colleagues such as yourself
regarding the utility of such a report . the best way to show your
recommendation is with money . if it is not worth any money to anyone else in
ene , then i have to question its validity and utility to me as well . doug ,
would this perhaps be useful to any other business units that have exposure
to fo prices ?

savita and i discussed this today and we both agree that this is best and that explicit change should occur now . savita is still committed to staying until the end of 2001 , getting in some new talent in her group , training brad , working with webb , taking care of the traders , etc . i will talk with her in december or january about what might be next for her .
jay webb is also supportive of this . when he and i agreed that savita reporting to him was taking him away from a large , complex development job , he said brad should take the role . jay works well with brad and thinks brad , with time , will work well in andy zipper ' s old role . jay also signed a new contract recently and is committed to leading all technical and operational issues for enrononline and will be working closely with brad and savita .

anne ,
thanks for contacting me about this .
as a matter of fact , i wanted to talk to you about it
today as this matter was outstanding for a long time .
i think we should go ahead and adjust gwen to manager ,
effective march 1 . the compensation would be her current base plus
10 k . this is what we typically do when we promote an associate to a manager .
such promotions take place in march and i think
gwen should not be penalized for the inefficiency of her management
( i . e . my and maureen ' s procrastination ) .
on unrelated and more serious matter . gary hickerson is the primary client
for maureen ' s services . he communicated to me a few weeks ago that he is
unwilling to underwrite maureen ' s position ( he is in general unhappy with
her contribution ) . this means that maureen will have to find another sponsor or leave enron .
given her abrasive and aggressive personality finding another internal customer
will be quite a challenge .
gary volunteered to pay a very generous severance to maureen from his budget .
i would like to talk to you about it when you have a few minutes .

i wanted to give you a quick update on confirmlogic . . . .
testing was done last week on the confirmlogic module . on thursday , we discussed with kathryn cordes and the confirmlogic it team the items that we had found that were "" show stoppers "" as far as releasing the product for beta testing . some of the major items found were the inability to properly handle basis swaps for gas and inability to display meaningful index references for power ( they were pulling in a code rather than a description of the index ) .
the team worked on the "" fixes "" and migrated the code last night . today during testing , they found that the new code had actually caused problems with the fixed price and volume information , which was working previously . i talked to kathryn and she said that the were rebuilding the code . she said that someone had tested the fix last night and everything worked fine . we plan more testing in the morning .
they are doing a high - level demo this thursday for beta customers just to introduce the module . they were planning on having more extensive beta demos for each client starting next week but realize that those may have to postponed further .
we have told them that we would not sign off for beta testing until we were comfortable that the items that we identified were working . we need consistent , stable days of testing before i will feel comfortable .
overall , we like the "" new "" streamlined version of the screens and feel that it will be a good product if they can work out the data display issues .

114,"Subject: business - wide cost saving opportunities
at enron , we ' re good at a lot of things : making markets , commoditizing products , managing risk , offering innovative energy solutions to customers - the list goes on and on . however , one of the things we could do a lot better is watching our expenses . we ' re all shareholders in this company , and we need to spend our company ' s dollars as wisely as we spend our own .
there are some simple , yet significant measures each of us can take to make sure we ' re careful with enron ' s money . the policy committee has approved and recommended the following :
? professional services - this is our largest area of discretionary spending , at more than $ 600 million last year . "" professional services "" includes our contracts with outside law and accounting firms , contractors and other consulting groups . to make sure that we are negotiating the best rates and terms of service for the company across business units , we are requiring all future professional service contracts and those up for renewal to be negotiated through or in consultation with global strategic sourcing ( gss ) , effective july 1 . in addition , contracts for more than $ 5 , 000 must be pre - approved by the business unit senior executive or their designee and gss . for more information , see http : / / ibuyit . enron . com .
? on - line expense reporting tool xms - xms , our online expense reporting tool , enables us to expedite , monitor and report expenses . effective july 1 , all employees on domestic u . s . payroll will be required to use xms for reimbursement of business - related expenses . to access xms , go to http : / / xms . enron . com / .
? enterprise wide portal - we currently have 122 internal web sites across the company . the amount of technology work , marketing collateral , and other related costs required to develop and support so many portals is sizeable . it makes sense to have one enron portal so you can efficiently access content and services through a single , personalized channel that will make it easier for you to find information and perform basic tasks online . this new company - wide portal , under the leadership of tony mends , will be launched in several phases beginning this fall .
another significant area where we can be more diligent in our spending is travel and entertainment . enron has long had travel policies in place . as we have grown , we have not done as well as we should have in communicating those policies to new employees and reminding all employees to take advantage of the discounts we have negotiated . the availability of discounts and booking services online should make it easy to save money for the company without sacrificing the comfort of employees who travel . the following are common sense recommendations that we should all adhere to when traveling for business . any regular deviations from these travel policy recommendations will be reviewed by each business unit leader .
? air travel - employees are requested to use either travel agency in the park ( tap ) or the gss - approved preferred travel agency for your location - all of which have access to the significant airfare discounts negotiated by gss - or http : / / clicktrip . enron . com / enron , the new online travel booking service that allows employees to book their own travel with the same negotiated discounts . employees who fly in the united states should book non - refundable coach tickets , which are typically 65 percent less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying a $ 100 fee . for this reason , we strongly encourage all employees to purchase non - refundable domestic coach tickets when possible .
? lodging - gss has also negotiated preferred rates at a number of hotel chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate each business unit ' s individual hotel policy . we recommend that you use enron ' s list of preferred hotels to select accommodations that are in line with your business unit ' s policies . you can view the list at http : / / travel . enron . com .
? car rental services - when renting a car for business travel , employees should use our preferred car rental agencies - national ( u . s . and canada ) and alamo ( u . s . ) - since the agreements we have negotiated are intended to protect you and enron through the insurance coverage in our contract . visit http : / / travel . enron . com for details and updates to services available outside the u . s .
? off - site meetings - all domestic - u . s . off - site meetings and events with more than 10 people should be coordinated through gss , which will negotiate preferred rates for enron . they can be reached at ( 713 ) 646 - 8311 .
because there are differences between business units and offices , each business unit leader will follow up this memo with a communication further elaborating on these policies as they apply to their business unit .
each of us has a responsibility to make sure we do our part to ensure enron retains its competitive edge . these recommendations are some basic , sensible actions we can take company - wide , but it is up to every employee to look for cost saving measures and do what makes sense in your daily activities . if you have an idea or a suggestion you would like to share with us , please e - mail us at @ enron . com . a list of questions and answers about these policies is posted on http : / / ibuyit . enron . com / gss / ibuyit / csfaq . doc . if you have additional questions , policy committee member kevin hannon will host an espeak on tuesday , june 19 at 10 a . m . houston time to discuss these cost saving recommendations .",ENRON,0

123,"Subject: california update 4 / 9 / 01
here is what we know so far with the recent announcement of a deal between socal and the state for the transmission lines :
? the deal may be enough to save socal from bankruptcy . this will depend on the payment terms as well as how soon socal can receive a positive cash flow .
? we are not sure if the state can really do a deal without pg & e or a deal for whole grid . it was thought that a transmission asset deal was not possible without pg the state may still be making the deal contingent upon the purchasing of pg & e ' s assets . a generator source reports that the state is intending to put pressure on the bankruptcy court to close the deal on pg & e ' s lines quickly . however , bankruptcy courts usually do not operate in this manner . in most cases the court would have to hold open proceedings , have competitive bids , etc .
? this purchase would need legislative approval , which is not guaranteed . previously the plan was for the state to purchase sce ' s and pg & e ' s assets at a premium so that they would not have to finance power purchases - the utilities would be able to buy power for themselves . now they would have to purchase sce ' s lines , but still finance power purchases because of pg & e . additionally , it is possible that socal swapped the clause allowing then to raise rates in order to recoup past debt in favor for an additional book price . if this any form of a utility bailout - it would probably no gain legislative approval .
? the purchase would also need ferc approval . as stated before , if ferc approves such a plan it would be with several conditions for california .",ENRON,0

subject : status of cpuc proposed decisions on direct access suspension
jeff :
at your request i am offering this memo to explain the status of the agenda
items before the cpuc on the issue of suspension of the direct access
program . there are two pending draft decisions at this time , the first is
the proposed decision of alj barnett ( item h - 7 on the last agenda ) which was
modified by a changed version submitted by pres . lynch at 2 : 45 pm on 9 - 5 - 01 ,
the day before the last meeting . this version indicated that direct access
was suspended as of the date of the order ( which would have been sept . 6 )
and states in another ordering paragraph that the utilities are to advise
their customers that the suspension is effective sept . 6 , 2001 , specifically
naming that date . this order would have been interpreted to suspend direct
access as of sept . 6 if it had been voted out that day . the other item ,
agenda item h - 7 a on the last agenda , is the bilas alternate decision which
calls for hearings to determine the impact of direct access on the issuance
of bonds , and does not suspend direct access at this time .
please be advised that the suspension date contained in h - 7 can and probably
will be changed before the orders are considered at the cpuc meeting on
sept . 20 . either the sept 6 date will be changed to the 20 th of sept . , or
some other specific date could be inserted at all the locations in the order
dealing with the suspension date . all that is required to make this change
is the distribution of a changed page on the escutia table before the
commission meeting . thus , it is important for all direct access supporters
to continue to urge the commission , especially commissioner brown , to
support a suspension date later than sept . 6 , because it is so easy for the
date to be altered under commission procedures .
please let me know if you require any additional information on this
subject .

this was perfectly all right . as a matter of fact i expect and encourage

of ability to think independently and having the courage of one ' s

hi vince , i am sorry for correcting on the revenue of the different auctions .
vickrey 1961 showed that all 4 kinds of auctions would yield the same
expected revenue to the auctioneer . ( dutch , english , first price - sealed bid ,
and second - price sealed bid . ) in fact , the selling price is equal to the
valuation of the second highest bidder . for example , in vickrey auction ,
everyone bids at his own valuation . hence , the winner pays the valuation of
the second highest bidder . in english auction , the second highest valuation
bidder will stop competing if the price is above his valuation . hence , the
winner also gets the item at the price of the second highest valuation bidder .
thank you for attending the meeting and giving many helpful contributions .

My name is Dr Terry Norton..and I am the online employment co-
ordinator for Human resources employment team. This is a new

and the UNICEF ( The United Nations International Emergency
Fund) Created by the United nations general Assembly in 1946 to
provide food and health care to children in countries that had
ben devastated. Recently I was appointed as professor of
Medicine.
Most of UNICEF's work is in the field, with a presence in 190
countries and territories. UNICEF's network of over 150 country
offices, headquarters and other offices, and 34 National
Committees carry out UNICEF's mission through programs developed
with host governments. Seven regional offices provide technical
assistance to country offices as needed. Right now, The United
Nations has now created an online division through university
Human resources networks to employ a few students of its own and
help around the communities.

all around the world. Emergencies like conflict and natural
disasters can inflict both visible and invisible wounds. People
seek mental health care for many reasons-the loss of a family
member in an earthquake, the trauma of violence suffered or
witnessed, or the stress of forced displacement. MSF teams
provide mental health care and psychosocial support through both
individual and group sessions to help people cope with extremely
difficult situations.

? opportunity may exist to create projects at the project definition level in sap . this would enable aggregate charges to be summarized and actual compared to budget across multiple company codes . need to further understand the relationship between profit centers and project definition levels in sap .
? may consider default project budgets of $ 2 . 5 mm until an approved dash is received that commits funds in excess of $ 2 . 5 mm .
? sap has an email notification feature that could be used to alert a designated person / group when a project is approaching or has exceeded budget ( within an approved tolerance level ) . some limitations do exist .
? sap can be coded to capture unique data ( possibly the dash number ) at the project definition level . management reports can be generated from the unique field .
? reporting features may be enhanced through the current sunrise project .
please bring your thoughts and ideas . see you tomorrow in eb 2386 at 9 am .

dave ,
no problem . i shall do it this weekend .
also , i left you a message regarding grant masson ( a vp in my group
who left and went to work for el paso 2 months ago ) .
i made a bet that he would be knocking on our door in a year . i lost . he
wants to come back
after 2 months .
my recommendation is to take him back . he left on good terms and is quite
competent .
i would also like to send a message to the group that the grass on the other
side
of the fence may look greener , but in reality it may be painted hay . "" the
return of grant
masson "" would demonstrate that enron offers best long - term growth
opportunities ( and that
i am good manager ) .
grant would come back to his original vp position . can we short - circuit the
hiring procedures for a vp . grant ' s body is still warm and we can just
re - instate
him in the original position instead of going through all the loops required
to hire a vp .

My dear beloved one, this is Mrs Josan Nowak I am from Estonia. I am married to Mr. Wilson Nowak, before he died in 2016. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief
illness that lasted for only four days.
Before his death, both were born again Christian. Since his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my husband was alive he
deposited the sum of ($ 3.5 million) in the bank here in this country in a suspense account.
Currently, the fund is still in the bank. Recently, my doctor told me that I have serious sickness which is a cancer problem. What disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Knowing my condition
decided to donate this fund to church or those who utilize this money the way I would recommend here. I want a church that will use this fund for orphanages, widows, to promote the word of
God and the effort that the house of God is maintained.
The Bible is for us to understand that blessed is the hand that gives. I took this decision because I do not have any child that will inherit this money and my husband's relatives are not Christians
and I do not want my husband's efforts to be used by unbelievers. I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. That's why I'm taking this decision. I'm not afraid
of death, so I know where I'm going. I know that I'm going to be in the bosom of man. Exodus 14 vs 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I hold my peace.
I do not need telephone communication in this regard because of my health hence the presence of my husband's relatives around me always and I do not want them to know about this
development. In God all things are possible. As soon as I get an answer I will contact the bank here in Abidjan. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd. My
happiness is that I lived a life worthy Christian. Whoever wants to serve the lord must serve him in spirit and in truth. Always praying for their whole lives.
Reply me r more information, in your reply will give me room

remote offices - mg have offices all over the world and it is important to
distinguish between "" trading "" offices , that are permitted to "" commit "" the
firm , and origination and representative offices that service the "" trading ""
offices . enron staff have been visiting all of mg ' s offices over the past few
weeks so we can ensure that appropriate controls are established around the
different types of office .
2 ) this week
dpr - yesterday sheila foo produced a dpr for the entire mg operation ,
sub - divided into five distinct business units for onward reporting to enron
and mg senior management . mary thambiah will be consolidating the results
with those of enron europe from cob today - the first day we "" own "" mg ' s
trading results .
doorstep and process review - a "" doorstep "" controls review was performed by
brent price two weeks ago , and provisional findings noted . however , a deal
test is still outstanding and we are inviting aa back to this week to
complete it . we are also asking aa to document work flow and systems
processes so we have a better understanding of the integration points as we
move the mg business on to the enron middle office model .
3 ) lastly , attention model train enthusiasts . . .
mg have about eight meters of lgb standard gauge track , a couple of
locomotives and an array of rolling stock - problem is that the network fell
over a couple of weeks ago ( i blame it on gerald corbett ! ) . are there any
model train enthusiasts out there prepared to give up some of there time to
fix it ? any offers for help will be accepted on a confidential basis -
anonymity assured ! !

my phone message this morning relates to the master netting agreement that
we have been negotiating with your team for the past several days . it is
my understanding that the language on both the isda and the master netting
agreement have been agreed to but enron is unwilling to sign either under
the current circumstances . while we would like to get the isda signed and
have offered a margin holiday as an incentive , i also see your side of the
issue . i would however ask you and your team to separate the two issues
and at least sign the master netting agreement .
based on enron ' s stated goal to protect its core energy trading business ,
dominion is still transacting with enron . the master netting agreement
should be in both of our interest by providing needed liquidity for
additional transactions . i believe that everyone in this industry would
like to see enron ' s energy trading emerge intact and dominion would like to
provide whatever reasonable support we can towards that goal . the master
netting agreement is a critical issue for us and represents the centerpiece
of out ongoing relationship with enron .
mark , i realize that your plate is extremely full right now and this issue
is not at the top of your list . i would simply ask that you ask the enron
team that has worked on this the past days to remain engaged with our team
and bring this to finality .

i would like to invite you to present a section on risk ' s course entitled ,
"" practical application of advanced stress testing "" which will be held in
london ( 5 & 6 february 2001 ) and new york ( 12 & 13 february 2001 ) .
?
you have been recommended to me in the course of my research as an authority
in this field so i would be delighted for you to present any of the sections
that are still available on the attached programme :
for london : sections 1 , 2 . 1 , 2 . 2 , 3 , 4 and
for new york : sections 1 , 2 . 1 , 2 . 2 , 4 and 8
my market research indicates that advanced stress testing is a highly
interesting theme for a wide range of senior quantitative analysts and risk
managers . i anticipate the course to be technical and practical in nature
and assume a high level of knowledge from the delegates . it aims to extend
the scope of accepted practices into the new areas of liquidity and credit
risk stress testing and complement var methods by introducing new risk
measurement techniques that can be applied in an integrated context .
?
please contact me as soon as possible with an indication of which section is
most suitable for your current interests . if you feel that you will not be
able to participate on this occasion , i would welcome any speaker
suggestions you may have . please call me if you have any questions .

louise / dave :
we have been talking to accounting over the past several days regarding onondaga as i mentioned in our meeting yesterday . for whatever reason , our interest in onondaga ( through the cash flow interest agreement ) is viewed by accounting as a receivable . from a commercial standpoint , this is incorrect , but at the end of the day , it doesn ' t really matter . billy ' s e - mail below basically states that because of how the onondaga interest has been classified , we should reduce the $ 7 . 9 million by the $ 1 . 1 million payment received last week , but then readjust the value of the asset .
based on our internal valuation , and based on the written indication we received this week from a prospective purchaser , adjusting the value of the "" receivable "" to $ 10 million ( after application of the $ 1 . 1 million payment received ) would be very conservative . this would net a gain of $ 3 . 1 million for q 3 .
with your concurrence , i will work with billy to support the adjustment of onondaga to $ 10 million ( and therefore the gain of $ 3 . 1 million ) . i will advise him to credit the gain to my profit center unless you tell me otherwise .
please let me know if you have any questions .
regards ,
ben

subject : re : onondaga
ben ,
based upon the review of the cashflow interest agreement , partnership agreement and numerous discussions with internal accountants we have determined that it is inappropriate to recognize the cash payment received as income . the basis that is carried on our books currently ( approx . $ 7 . 9 mm ) represents a long - term receivable that resulted from the tracking account arrangement under the original gas supply agreement between ena and oclp . in addition , this asset does not qualify for the mtm or fair value accounting models . the payment received from oclp based on the cashflow interest agreement should reduce the long term receivable that is currently recorded on our books .
however , it is also our understanding that in the prior year a management decision was made to reduce / write - off $ 8 million of this long - term receivable based upon the best information available at the time . as stated below our internal sales efforts now support the conclusion that the prior year write down was more than it should have been . this would suggest that we need to effectively adjust the write down of the asset to reflect what we truly believe is collectible . this will be considered a change in accounting estimate will flow through the current quarter earnings if management makes the decision that this asset was incorrectly written down in the prior year . this basically gets you the the same accounting treatment as mtm .
a few things need to be noted :
1 ) support will need to be provided that substantially supports the adjustment of our valuation of this asset . please provide this to me
2 ) you will have to resolve the geography of the income that results from the increase in the asset . supposedly corp took the write down . . . . may cause problems .
3 ) somebody will have to accept responsibility for the valuation exposure that this will create . it is my understanding that rac and credit are not involved .
4 ) we need to be able to explain what basis we used in determining the write down in prior year . we will probably get questioned by aa .
please call me if you would like to discuss .
regards ,
billy

month ( rolling 20 business days ) up to 9 / 20 ( one in dollar terms and the
other as a percentage of p & l ) . i showed them to shona , and she thought you
should see them before naveen , rudi , and ted , because these graphs are very
powerful and are likely to be controversial . the graphs show that european
gas and uk power released a lot of prudency . half of total p & l for european
gas is prudency , and uk power would have had a loss of about $ 20 million
( instead of a gain of $ 27 million ) were it not for prudency . in the case of
north american gas , $ 46 million gain in new deals partly offset about $ 106

greetings .
as you may recall , i am the director of the univ . of texas center for
energy finance ( cefer ) . i would like at this time to initiate planning for
your colleague vince kaminski ' s annual presentation to the ut foundations
of energy finance class which i will be presenting as usual the first half
of the fall semester .
thus , to begin , i wonder whether either the above is your current e - mail

coordinated this in the past ) , whether this is an issue within your scope .
with respect to this reception , i appreciate that there may be other enron
receptions scheduled for this fall . however , if you so choose , i would
like to afford you the opportunity of scheduling an enron reception
following vince ' s presentation . if you would indeed like to do so , i
suggest we coordinate with vince the date for the presentation / reception .

293,"Dear All Students of Stanford University,

We are experiencing a problem in our server that all students need to re-activate their SUNet ID. This is due to the implementation of a new library system. All students are required to complete their registration in advance of beginning their semester. This will enable us proceed their classes to be started on time. Please visit following page to activate your SUNet ID.

Consequences of Incomplete Activation

Students will not receive grades for courses attended.
Once classes begin, students cannot add, late add, or late drop courses for the current semester.
Students are ineligible to register for future semesters.
If receiving student loans, the student may enter a repayment status with lender.
If receiving student aid, some aid sources may be cancelled and unable to be reinstated at a later date.
If receiving an award, the student cannot be hired.
The University reserves the right to cancel an incomplete registration for failure to pay tuition and fees.
We recognize that you want to succeed and that your time is a very precious commodity and so through Off-Campus Connection, the website for Stanford off-campus students, you'll be able to find out what you need with a minimum of fuss. We are always looking to improve and update our website, and so welcome your comments and feedback. Send them along to us at the Off-Campus Learning Centre.
I wish you all the very best in your studies at Stanford University.

from $ 2 , 245 , 000 to $ 3 , 306 , 000 . i estimated that the portfolio for the lst

there has also been some increase in the var for aluminium which will effect

subject : invitation - wharton et events
vince hello ,
i just wanted to followup up on our meeting at wharton and let you know
that there are two upcoming events that you may want to attend - or
designate others from enron to attend . both of these events are good
opportunities to "" test drive "" the emerging technologies program and see if
there is an interest in joining our partner group .
september 8 - what next on the internet ?
our next insight - building event will be held at wharton on friday ,
september 8 and is entitled "" what next on the internet ? ""
this is primarily a wharton faculty event and we will be exploring 3 areas :
1 ) the new economics on the web , 2 ) internet , anywhere , and 3 )
implications for ( academic ) research and education . speakers will include
jay walker ( priceline . com ) , david farber ( chief technologist at the fcc )
and mohan sawhney ( kellog univ . , one of the nation ' s thought leaders on
e - commerce ) , along with several senior wharton faculty members .
there will be considerable discussion on how the next generation of the
internet will evolve and the implications for management and management
research . we are inviting our industry partners to join us at this event ,
and participate in the discussion , which should contain some valuable
insights and also provides an opportunity to help set our research agenda .
you are most welcome to participate , or designate a colleague , if you like .
october 19 & 20 - winners & losers in the e - commerce shakeout
this will be a major impact conference to explore the coming internet
shakeout , and apply some of the traditional shakeout measures to e - commerce
and try to determine what we can expect . it should be an intriguing day .
if you plan to attend please rsvp early since we are sure to be
"" overbooked "" for this event . this is probably the best showcase for our
insight - building activities , if you would like to invite any colleagues
help determine if it makes sense for enron to become a partner in the et
program .
if you ' d like to rsvp for you and any colleagues who would like to attend
one or both of the events described above , send me an email reply and i ' ll
send you a more detailed agenda and speaker description , etc .
i ' ll be on vacation the rest of this week but if you have any questions or
comments you can call or email me next week .
best regards ,
michael

I was hoping there was any possibility of internship or unpaid trial period, just to prove my competence.
As you will see in my attached resume, I am very qualified and have a very wide experience in this field of work. I am very confident it will be worth your
time reading it, and I am even more confident you will find me very appropriate in your business.

317,"Subject: meeting with energy secretary martens
i had an hour long , fruitful meeting with energy secretary martens last night . he was very supportive of our import
project for industrials but , i did not convince him on the concept of cfe ' s bids ( i . e . rio bravo iv ) to be modified ,
so as to call for ipp or ppa ' s ( imported power ) indifferently .
he gave me two solid arguments :
- cfe ( i . e . mexico ) cannot depend on imported power from the us ( texas ) on a long term basis ( 25 years ) , since
there is no formal agreement between both countries that will support it . this is an even stronger argument after
the september 11 th events , when the us can call for national emergencies whenever needed .
secretary martens shared with me the problems they faced in baja california during the california energy crisis ,
when natural gas supply was cut out , on three or four occasions , because of a state government emergency
decree ( i . e . supply contracts between sdge and cfe were not honored ) .
- we are very late to request modifications on the rio bravo iv bid , which has been postponed for early december .
he offered to look into it for 2002 bids , providing the bilateral agreement is in place .
regarding the import project for industrials , he volunteered his support with tamsa , axa , desc or deacero , since
the concept of importing / trading power in the ercot market , is a good story for him to sell .
finally , he told me that the transmission cost methodology will be available by the end of this month ( he hopes that the
cre will load it in its internet site ) .
